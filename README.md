# AtliQ Attendance Analysis Dashboard

ðŸŒ¤ Not an HR professionalâ€¦ but for a few days, I became one.

This project analyzes attendance data for AtliQ Technologies, transforming messy Excel files into a Power BI dashboard that provides actionable HR insights. It highlights trends, employee behavior, and potential concerns.

## Problem Statement

HR managers often struggle with messy attendance data: mismatched columns, cryptic leave codes, and pressure to spot trends. This project aims to provide clarity and actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Key Steps

- Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to clean raw Excel sheets.  
- Data Transformation: Unpivoted date columns and standardized leave codes.  
- DAX Measures: Calculated work-from-home days, partial leaves, and real presence.  
- Dashboard Features: KPIs, slicers, filters, and visuals for easy analysis.  
- Insights Extraction: Weekly patterns, top performers, remote loyalists, and potential concerns.

## Key Insights

- 91.83% Presence Rate: Strong overall team attendance.  
- 10% WFH Rate: Peaks on Thursdays (11.5%) and Fridays (13%).  
- 1.1% Sick Leave: Highest on Mondays (1.62%).  
- Top Performers (100% Presence): Alyson Huber, Charity Singleton, Ciara Allison.  
- Remote Loyalists: Alexander Davenport (100% WFH), Andrew Cummings (40% WFH).  
- Potential Concerns: Employees with low presence and rising absenteeism.  
- Weekly Patterns: Best days for team activities are Mondayâ€“Wednesday; attendance dips on Friday.

## Lesson Learned

- Data isnâ€™t just numbersâ€”it tells stories of people, habits, and workplace culture.  
- You donâ€™t need to be in HR to provide HR solutionsâ€”empathy, curiosity, and data skills are key.

## Final Takeaway

This dashboard turns raw attendance data into actionable insights for decision-making, highlighting trends, employee performance, and organizational patterns.
